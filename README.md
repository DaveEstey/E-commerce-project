# E-commerce-project

## Description
  
This project is to be used as an understanding of how to use different requests to alter and access a database using routes and models. In this project, you can see how you can add categories, products and tags to a database and store them with relations to each other. I learned that the more interconnectivity you have between objects, the harder it is to change things.
